# Pride
Pride is a JavaScript library that is currently under development. It handles all communication between your front-end application and the U-M Library searches backend (currently this backend is being developed using Spectrum).

When it is ready for use, we wil add documentation on how to use it. Until then, please contact me with any questions.
